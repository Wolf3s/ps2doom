PS2Doom - Playstation 2 Doom Source Port. List of things to do:

- Improve sound quality - sample rate of 44.1khz and a bit depth of 16 bits per sample, stereo, with 8 simultaneous channels (minimum). 32 Channels would be great.
- Add music support.
- Improve graphics quality up to the 480i, 480p and up-scaled 1080i resolution. Progressive scan option, also.
- Add cheat code support. Reuse the code from PSPDoom Version 1.4 by Chilly Willy. It's just perfect.
- Message output when revealing secrets: "You found a secret area!".
- Support for demo recording and playback.
- Support for some command line parameters like "No Monsters", "Fast Monsters", "Respawn Monsters" and others.
- Support for loading PWADs files.
